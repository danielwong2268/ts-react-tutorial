This project is bootstraped with the command below:
create-react-app tutorial --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts

The examples are fully coded out - I suggest trying to implement yourself as you watch the videos.

You can find some examples in `/tutorial/learn-typescript`
There are some further React examples in `/src/Examples`. I import them separately into `App.tsx` in the demos.

To start the app:
1. run `yarn install` to install dependencies
2. run `yarn start` to start the application

Text Editor
I use VSCode because it has good built in Typescript support.
